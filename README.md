# Britain-Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction

This is a group project I completed with another three classmates during my Data Science course. In this project we were analyzing UK road accidents data from 2005 to 2017 (source: https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles).

This section is a comprehensive experiment containing all concepts we learned from the Data Science class, including exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and modeling. It is a huge data set (1 GB) for us to explore insights and play with data. We made statistical graphs, heat maps, geoplots, and contingency tables. In addition, we did feature engineering by creating an interaction term, data standardization as well as data resampling.

In the modeling part, we applied hyperparameter tuning twice to further improve our models' performance. After the first hyperparameter tuning was done, permutation testing was conducted to figure out which prediction variables made the greatest difference to our target variables (i.e. the road severity we studied). Then we performed the second hyperparameter tuning only using the most important prediction variables to improve our models.

It was definitely a great experience for me to appreciate, master, and apply the knowledge of data science via this project.
