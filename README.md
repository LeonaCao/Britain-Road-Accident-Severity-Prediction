# Road-Accident-Severity-Prediction

This is a group project I completed with another three classmates during my Data Science course. In this project we were analyzing UK road accidents data from 2005 to 2017 (source: https://www.kaggle.com/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles).

This section is a comprehensive experiment containing all concepts we learned from the Data Science class, including exploratory data analysis, data visualizations, and modeling. It is a huge data set (1 GB) for us to explore insights and play with data. We made statistical graphs, heat maps, geoplots, and contingency tables. In addition, we did feature engineering such as ploynomials and interaction terms and data standardization. 

Whereas in the modeling part, we applied hyperparameter tuning twice to further improve our models' performance. Feature importance was also conducted by us to understand which variables made the greatest difference to our target variables, which is the road severity we studied.
